    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Nothing beats a heart-warming, soul-completing bowl of chicken and rice soup.
         Its near-medicinal properties will warm even the coldest heart, and heal any
          illness (this statement not assessed by the FDA). It's ridiculously simple
         to make and requires only a miniscule amount of time out of your busy day to 
        make - and make it <em> great</em>. </p>

        <p> In this post, we will show you not only how to make this classic dish, but 
            give you the recipe to make it the <em> good way!</em> </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> 3 Whole carrots, sliced </li>
            <li> 4 Whole celery stalks, sliced </li>
            <li> 1 Whole white or brown onion, diced </li>
            <li> 2 whole chicken breasts, shredded </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup white rice </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup olive oil or your favorite cooking oil </li>
            <li> 4 cups chicken or veggie stock </li>
            <li> 1/2 tbsp dried thyme 
            <li> 1/2 tsp salt </li>
            <li> 1 tsp pepper </li>
        </ul>
            
    <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> Fill a small pot with water. Place on the stove and bring to a rolling
                boil. Once boiling, place raw chicken breasts into water and allow to cook
                thoroughly. </li>
            <li> Add the oil to a soup pot and heat on medium heat. </li>    
            <li> While the chicken is cooking, slice the carrots and celery, and dice the 
                onion. Add the sliced veggies to the soup pot and saute until the onions
             are transparent. </li>
             <li> Pour the chicken or veggie stock into the pot. Use the last bit to deglaze. </li>
             <li> Add the spices to the soup and stir. </li>
             <li> Maintain medium heat and allow the soup to come to a light boil. </li>
             <li> Once the chicken is cooked, shred and add into the soup along with the rice. </li>
             <li> Allow a light boil for about 10 minutes. </li>
             <li> Your delicious soup is ready to serve! </li>
        </ol>
