        <ul>
            <li> 2 whole carrots, shaved or sliced </li>
            <li> 1 head of broccoli, chopped </li>
            <li> 1/2 yellow onion, sliced </li>
            <li> 3 green onions, chopped </li>
            <li> 1/2 bell pepper, sliced (optional) </li>
            <li> 5-6 mushrooms, sliced (optional) </li>
            <li> Soba or Udon noodles </li>
            <li> 1 chicken breast, sliced <em> or </em> 1/2 lb. beef, sliced </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce </li>
            <li> 1/4 cup sesame oil or your favorite cooking oil </li>
            <li> Sesame seeds to top (optional) </li>
            <p> <strong> Note: </strong> We <em> highly </em> recommend using sesame oil 
            as opposed to any other cooking oil due to the flavor it imparts on the veggies. 
            If you don't have it, it's not necessary but adds a lot to the overall dish flavor.</p>
        </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Prep veggies and cook your noodles. </li>
            <li> Combine all your veggies in a skillet with oil and saute until golden brown. </li>
            <li> Cook meat with oil in a separate pan. Once cooked, slice into strips. </li>
            <li> Add meat and veggies into the same pan and stir in sauce to combine. </li>
            <li> Add noodles into the mixture. </li>
            <li> Top with sliced green onion, and optional sesame seeds. </li>

        </ol>
